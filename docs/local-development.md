# Local Development and Running
To develop and running typhoon on your local machine you need to understand the basic about docker and have docker installed. To install docker you can follow the link [here](https://github.com/bukalapak/typhoon/blob/main/docs/docker-installation.md).

## Clone The Repo
First clone typhoon into your local machine

git clone git@github.com:bukalapak/typhoon.git
```

## Build Docker Image

```

## Create DB, Migrate and Seed
Run the command below to create db, migrate and seed the data
```bash
docker-compose run --rm app dockerize -wait tcp://mysql:3306 rails db:create db:migrate db:seed

## Run The Server
There are several ways to run the server from docker compose:

* Normal Way. To exit the app simply use Ctrl+C
```bash
docker-compose up app
```

* Detach or running in the background.
```bash
docker-compose up -d app
```
Use this command to stop the server
```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Setup Grafana (Optional)
